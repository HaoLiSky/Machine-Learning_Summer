Goal: Modular Python Framework to fit neural networks to energy/force landscapes

Module 1 (Red Team):
Development goals (short term):
-select testing system (clusters? molecules? crystals?)
-obtain sufficiently-large training data set (structures, forces, energies)

Package goals (long term):
-functions for data generation (random generation, symmetry groups, etc)
-interfacing with existing databases?
-prebuilt (included) testing data sets?
-interfacing with VASP and LAMMPS optional?

Module 2 (Blue Team):
Development goals (short term):
-examine molML code
-examine AMP code

Package goals (long term):
-calls to OpenBabel for reading structures?
-multiple, user-selectable data representation schemes
-output NN-formatted data, with transformations as necessary

Module 3 (Yellow Team):
Development goals (short term):


Package goals (long term):
-multiple, user-selectable neural networks
-benchmarking for comparison?
